üìå Project Summary

In this data analysis project, I explored and visualized sales data from Blinkit, a quick commerce company, to uncover insights about customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance. The project was executed entirely in Python using popular data science libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

1) Python

2) Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning

3) NumPy for numerical operations

4) Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

üß© Key Steps Undertaken:

1) Data Import & Cleaning: Loaded a CSV file containing Blinkit's sales data.Handled encoding issues during import.

2) Cleaned the dataset by dealing with missing values and standardizing data formats.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Analyzed product-wise and category-wise sales performance.

- Identified best-selling products and top-performing categories.

- Explored sales distribution over days, months, and other time-based trends.

4)Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.

-Highlighted patterns in customer preferences and seasonal sales peaks.

5)Actionable Insights: Discovered which products are consistently high performers.

-Identified potential low-performing SKUs for optimization.

-Analyzed the impact of seasonal changes and days of the week on sales volume.
